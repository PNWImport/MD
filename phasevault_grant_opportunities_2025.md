## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS FOR REVIEWERS

**PhaseVault's Unique Position:**
1. **Only encrypted + version-controlled database on market**
2. **Production-ready code** (not vaporware)
3. **Compliance documentation complete** (FIPS, HIPAA, NIST)
4. **On-premises deployment** (no cloud vendor lock-in)
5. **Blockchain-verified lineage** (tamper-evident)
6. **6.4× compression advantage** (QuanJP++ algorithm)
7. **Apache 2.0 license** (government-friendly)
8. **Zero foreign nationals** (IP security)

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Common Rejection Reasons:
1. **Lack of customer validation** → Get LOIs from 3 government users
2. **Unclear commercialization** → 30-day GTM plan already done ✓
3. **Technical uncertainty** → Working prototype eliminates this ✓
4. **Small market** → $1.8B TAM well-documented ✓
5. **Foreign ownership concerns** → U.S.-owned, no foreign nationals ✓

### Mitigation Strategy:
- Apply to multiple programs simultaneously (portfolio approach)
- Leverage working prototype for fast Phase I execution
- Use Phase I funding to hire SBIR grant writing consultant ($10K-$15K)
- Attend agency "proposers days" for networking
- Join SBIR/STTR support programs (free mentorship)
